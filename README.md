# Visual Inspection System

A cost-effective, machine vision-based inspection system designed to automate quality control for small manufacturing environments. This project uses **PyQt6** and **OpenCV** to provide a user-friendly interface that assists operators in measuring and verifying the dimensions of parts with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Precision Measurement**: Achieves an accuracy within 1 mm for simple dimensional inspections.
- **Contour and Depth Detection**: Uses stereo vision and depth data to calculate part dimensions and detect contours in real time.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Blueprint-style layout for easy setup and inspection of part dimensions, reducing the need for specialized training.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **PyQt6**: GUI framework for building the user interface.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision library for contour detection and edge analysis.
- **Intel RealSense Camera**: Depth-sensing camera for dimension calculations.
